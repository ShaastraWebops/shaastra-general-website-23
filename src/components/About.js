            Shaastra is the annual technical festival of the Indian Institute of
            Technology Madras (IITM), Chennai, India. The Sanskrit word
            ‘Shaastra’ means science and the festival accordingly consists of
            various engineering, science, and technology competitions, summits,
            lectures, video conferences, exhibitions, demonstrations and
            workshops. The festival is traditionally held over four days and
            four nights from 26th to 29th January. It has so far seen twenty-two
            editions, having started in its current avatar in the year 2000.
            Shaastra is entirely student-managed and is the first such event in
            the world to be ISO 9001:2015 certified.
